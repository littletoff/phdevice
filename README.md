This is Ben's pH-Sonde project for his Maturaarbeit.
In this GitHub page you will find the code for the arduino-powered pH-measurement device,
the code for the Web-App and the other files needed to host it via Heroku. (Procfile, requirements.txt)


Dear Mr. Ren√© Vielgut 

If you're reading this, please grade me kindly. I, respectfully, worked my ass of on this project.

Kind regards

Ben


P.S. This is my dad's Github page, he has some other stuff on here too. Ignore all that. Or don't. I don't really care.
